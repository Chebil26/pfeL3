its just a simple django project with some main CRUD functions and authentification 

its a website for a gym where you can see the available subscribtions or change them based on the type of user your authentified as, 

it has 3 types of users:
  the admin wich you could say is the owner and he has access and can change everything
  the coach wich can add update or delete his lessons 
  and the subscriber wich he can view the planning, lessons available, and can subscribe to lessons
  and just the website visiteur wich he can view the plannings and all 
  
 its written in python using the django framework
 the frontend work aint really that great 
 its mostly to show what i can do backend wise
